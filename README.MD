Hiscore save/load:

Highscore saving is untested.

To save your hiscores manually, press the 'Save Settings' option in the OSD.  Hiscores will be automatically loaded when the core is started.

To enable automatic saving of hiscores, turn on the 'Autosave Hiscores' option and press the 'Save Settings' option in the OSD.  Hiscores will then be automatically saved (if they have changed) any time the OSD is opened.

Hiscore data is stored in /media/fat/config/nvram/ as ```<mra filename>.nvm```
